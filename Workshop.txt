description=[i][b]Superb Survivors![/b] compatibility - 12/13/2020
description=Last update of this mod should be working with Superb Survivors without known issues, and how it works? in Superb Survivors are survivors spawned as AI controlled players so they share all functionality e.g. if survivor is attacking zombie, health bar will show up and you will see damage dealt.[/i]
description=
description=[b]Known issues:[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*] [i]B41 - car "hits" are not shown (11/25/2020 - currently there is no lua even on vehicle hit, so this goes on hold for now)[/i]
description=[*] [i]B40 - bar can hide itself when you stand on top of zombie (12/27/2020 - eased zombie alpha value is not exposed in B40 and currently used exposed property is sometimes overridden during zombie rendering, so this is not likely be fixed in B40)[/i]
