description=[i][b]Superb Survivors![/b] compatibility - 02/05/2021
description=Last update of this mod should be working with Superb Survivors without known issues, and how it works? in Superb Survivors are survivors spawned as AI controlled players so they share all functionality e.g. if survivor is attacking zombie, health bar will show up and you will see damage dealt. Health bar will also appear above survior head when damaged.[/i]
